Thanks for the feedback, and glad to hear the tutorial was useful getting you started.  :)

Yes, all Fuse and Mixamo content is available for commercial and non commercial use, royalty free.  
You can edit them to your hearts content!

The only requirement we have is that the final product you are creating must have our content in an 'embedded', non-editable format.  
So you can't edit the characters and sell them directly, because then other people have access to the character 3d data files.  
Games, movies, 3d prints, 2D illustrations, or any other file format where the character/animation files are not-editable is fine.  
Selling characters/animations directly is against the TOS/EULA.

Hope that helps clarify!
