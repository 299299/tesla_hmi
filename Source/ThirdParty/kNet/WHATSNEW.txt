Version 2.7, 2012-03-23
-----------
- Added new InOrderTest sample.
- Added support for duplicating datagrams in NetworkSimulator.
- Fixed a bug in duplicated message receive handling.
- Added support for corrupting datagrams in NetworkSimulator.
- Added support for 64-bit memory pointer to 32-bit splicing issue detecting for Windows.
- Removed KNET_THREAD_CHECKING_ENABLED from being enabled if USE_BOOST is enabled. This is to avoid a bug with boost::thread_id() not working across dynamic library boundaries. (KNET_THREAD_CHECKING_ENABLED and USE_BOOST are now mutually exclusive)

Version 2.6, 2012-01-25
-----------
- Implement a NetworkSimulator middle layer for adding delays and packet loss to outbound messaging (UDP only).
- Enhance DataSerializer with new data types:
   - lossy quantized floats
   - minifloats
   - arithmetic encoding
   - linear algebra types: quaternion, vector, spherical direction vectors with or without magnitude
- Incorporate TinyXML inside kNet repository, to avoid requiring extra configuration.
- Pass UDP datagram packet ID to client code for manual client-side latest-data-guarantee checks.
- Enable build on MinGW GCC 4.6.1 version 20111118.
- Bug fixes.

Version 2.5, 2012-01-02
-----------
- Fix build on Mac.
- Performance improvements.
- Added pthreads support for linux and Mac. Thanks to Lasse Öörni for the implementation.
- Improved networking statistics window display.
- Bug fixes.
